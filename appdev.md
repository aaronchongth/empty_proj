# app development :telephone_receiver:

I will be focusing on using `flutter` for app development, due to the following reasons,

* I have no prior `java` programming experience

* I found `android studio` highly unintuitive and a big pain to use

* I started learning around the same time `flutter` came to be, so there was absolutely no inertia for me to pick up and learn this more modern framework

* I love the idea of building apps using `widgets`

This workflow will be in note-taking form, as I am pretty much starting from scratch :hammer:
